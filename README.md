This repo is my begginig on C++ 
I will take some notes here about the curiositys , fundamentals , all the stuf involved with this language . 

What about all this terms of compilation ,  .cpp , .obj , .exe , .pdb , .ilk ? 

'.cpp' is the file wich we create 
'.obj' it is a intermediate file. The compilator (cl.exe for example ) traduce the code C++ a machine code , for CPU . 
'.exe' Executable file  . It takes all the necesary '.obj'  and it make only, one executable file . 
'.pdb' (Program Data Base) It have all the info for link the code machine (.exe) with our code (.cpp)
'.ilk' (Incremental Link File) It save the info about the last linked for the next compilation , It do more fast the future changes . 


For use C++ on VSC in Windows , we will need , ofc the extensions in VSC . But also we need to install the compiler . 
You can find this compiler in  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp#_install-a-compiler    .
Also you can add the extension of "Code Runner" in VSC , because It just will make the '.exe' files on your program , If you do not use this extension or another equal to this one , you will have all de terms wich 
I mention before .
