/*
Have you wondered how old your cat is when they are older? Your furry friend might be cute and small, but they are older than you realize! 🐱
To put it into perspective: The first two cat years count as 24 human years (the first year = 15 human years, the second year = 9 human years).
Each additional cat year counts as 4 human years.
Write a C++ program that asks the user to enter their cat's age and then calculate the equivalent human age right meow.
